# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: PCA and Kernel PCA

This repository contains Python implementations of two major dimensionality reduction techniques applied to different datasets: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST dataset and Kernel PCA on the Swiss roll dataset. These projects demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in image compression and non-linear data transformation.

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: PCA with the MNIST Dataset
**Objective:** Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset, visualizing the reduction effect and evaluating the compression by comparing original and transformed images.

### Project 2: Kernel PCA on Swiss Roll Dataset
**Objective:** Explore the effectiveness of Kernel PCA with various kernels (linear, RBF, and sigmoid) on a Swiss roll dataset to achieve optimal unfolding and classification using GridSearchCV to find the best kernel and parameters.

## Installation

To run these projects, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
